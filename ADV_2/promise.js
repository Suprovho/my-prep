//! PROMISE ->

//* Before promise we used to depend on callback functions which would result in 1.) Callback Hell (Pyramid of doom) | 2.) Inversion of control

// inversion of control means ur giving control of our func to another func..

// 2. Inversion of control is overcome by using promise. 

//*  2.1) A promise is an object that represents eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous operation.
//   2.2) A promise has 3 states: pending | fulfilled | rejected.
//   2.3)  As soon as promise is fulfilled/rejected => It updates the empty object which is assigned undefined in pending state.
//   2.4) A promise resolves only once and it is immutable. 
//   2.5) Using .then() we can control when we call the cb(callback) function.

//* 3. To avoid callback hell (Pyramid of doom) => We use promise chaining. This way our code expands vertically instead of horizontally. Chaining is done using '.then()'
// 4. A very common mistake that developers do is not returning a value during chaining of promises in explicit. Always remember to return a value. This returned value will be used by the next .then()

//! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

const cart=["shoes","pants","shirts","kurta"];

// promise chaining

createOrder(cart)
 .then((orderID)=>proceedToPayment(orderID))
 .then((paymentInfo)=>showOrderSummary(paymentInfo))
 .then((paymentInfo)=>updateWalletBalance(paymentInfo))


//!NOTE: 
//* we attach the callback function with promise object not pass it
